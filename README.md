### About this Project
International News Project is a satirical news site where most of the article content and images are created by OpenAI's GPT-3 and DALLÂ·E, respectively. The article titles are not generated by OpenAI.

## Hosting
* Currently hosted using GCP Compute Instance, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, and a Cloud Storage Bucket for static images. A little overkill for such a simple app, but it works!
